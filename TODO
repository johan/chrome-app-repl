- security protection (make it so that the sandboxed iframe can only run api functions that were in the initially eval-ed text)
- handle FileEntry results
- generalize serialization (e.g. turning of callbacks into id references) and make recursive (e.g. for arrays)
- handle functions that don't return a value (map them to callbacks anyway?) like chrome.runtime.getURL
- fix greeting message (currently black-on-black)
- support multi-line input (see jqconsole.Prompt)
- add necessary manifest entries to enable use of the identity API
- mention caveats about sync functions
- add command to dump all api definitions
- hook up events
- persist command history in storage
