- security protection (add "enabled APIs" to context menu, sandbox can't run APIs that aren't enabled)
- handle FileEntry results
- generalize serialization (e.g. turning of callbacks into id references) and make recursive (e.g. for arrays)
- handle functions that don't return a value (map them to callbacks anyway?) like chrome.runtime.getURL
- support multi-line input (see jqconsole.Prompt)
- add necessary manifest entries to enable use of the identity API
- mention caveats about sync functions
- isolate sandbox implementation from eval by putting it in an anonymous function
- mention built-ins in README
- support _ for event listeners
